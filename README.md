# To do

- Make issue branch names selectable
- On select, create a local branch in git

- Only 'started' issues are retrieved now, but this can also be a complete list
- On selection of an item, the Linear API can be used to set the item in progress
- After setting the item in progress in Linear, the local branch can be created

# Execution

The application should be executable from anywhere on the system

# Environment

The application currently only runs when certain packages are installed with venv. A requirements file should be added so that other users can also run the application without having to find out what packages should be installed first.
